# 500px Wallpaper for Android

## Why

There weren't any free/open source 500px wallpapers so I decided to make one.

## How

500px Wallpaper isn't a wallpaper per se, but an app that periodicly updates your wallpaper.
It doesn't run in the background except when changing the wallpaper, which only takes a few seconds.
This mean one less service running and eating resources.

## When

500px Wallpaper has not been released to Google Play yet, but it will be soon.
